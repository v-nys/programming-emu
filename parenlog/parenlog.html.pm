◊h2{Parenlog}
◊abstract{◊a[#:href "https://github.com/jeapostrophe/parenlog"]{Parenlog} is a both an embedded and a standalone language for logic programming in Racket. It can be used for automated deductive reasoning and integrates with existing Racket predicate functions.} If you're into deductive reasoning and logic puzzles, this project is for you. You'll need to know some Racket, but not a lot. Roughly, you've built ◊em{something} in Racket on your own, or you've gone through ◊a[#:href "https://www.nostarch.com/realmofracket.htm"]{◊work{Realm of Racket}}. You'll also need to know just a little bit about macros (I strongly recommend ◊a[#:href "http://www.greghendershott.com/fear-of-macros/"]{◊work{Fear of Macros}}).
 
◊caveat{The original code and my own reimplementation are LGPL code.}
