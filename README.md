Programming Emu is a book I am writing to improve my understanding of Racket.
I take existing, high-quality Racket projects, break down how they work and then try to rebuild them (or a simplified version) from scratch.

The book is now online at [programming-emu.com](programming-emu.com).

This project was inspired by [Beautiful Racket](www.beautiful-racket.com), [Python Practice Projects](http://pythonpracticeprojects.com/) and [Let's Build a Simple Interpreter](https://ruslanspivak.com/).

The MIT license is used wherever possible.
However, the code of a source project could have a different license and it may be required that derivative works use the same license, in which case I will comply.
This will always be mentioned explicitly.
