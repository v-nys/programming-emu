Racket + shell = Rash. If you love the terminal, but would like to do more serious programming in your shell scripts, ◊a[#:href "https://github.com/willghatch/racket-rash"]{William Hatch's project} should be right up your alley. It's a shell (like Bash, Zsh, Fish,...) written in Racket, but it's also a Racket REPL and a library. It interoperates with Racket in ways that no other shell can match. Want to run a pipeline of UNIX utilities from inside your Racket program? Rash has got you covered. Want to do some more serious programming inside your shell command or script? Escape to Racket and use its full power. I've also found that building a shell from scratch is a great way to learn to appreciate its capabilities.

Familiarity with at least one UNIX shell is helpful and this project is somewhat more challenging than Parenlog, but if you can build something useful in Racket on your own, you're probably good to go. I'll refer to additional reading material for each part of the shell as we go along.
