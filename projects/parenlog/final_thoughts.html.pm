◊h2{Conclusion}
This chapter showed how to build a functional Prolog-like DSL, but it was not intended as a complete introduction to logic programming. If you are intrigued by logic programming, I recommend checking out ◊a[#:href "http://www.amzi.com/AdventureInProlog/"]{Adventure in Prolog} or ◊a[#:href "http://www.learnprolognow.org/"]{Learn Prolog Now!}, both of which are playful, smooth introductions. If you enjoyed building a domain-specific language, you can't go wrong with ◊a[#:href "http://beautifulracket.com/"]{Beautiful Racket}.

If you've developed a taste for logic programming in general and want to see what's out there besides Prolog, ◊a[#:href "http://www.mercurylang.org/"]{Mercury} and ◊a[#:href "http://picat-lang.org/"]{Picat} are more recent languages worth looking into.
